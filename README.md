## How UniJoin Bitcoin Mixer & CoinJoin Service Works

UniJoin utilizes a combination of transaction mixing and CoinJoin techniques:

1. **Generate a Unique Deposit Address**  
   Users start by generating a unique deposit address, unlinkable to their identity.

2. **Transaction Mixing**  
   Bitcoin sent to the deposit address is fragmented and mixed with other user deposits, breaking links between input and output transactions.

3. **CoinJoin Aggregation**  
   UniJoin aggregates multiple user transactions into a combined CoinJoin transaction, making it difficult for chain analysis to identify individual transaction paths.

4. **Time‑Delayed Redistribution**  
   After a configurable delay, the mixed and aggregated funds are redistributed to user‑specified addresses, further improving privacy.

These methods help break deterministic transaction patterns, making it harder to trace the origin of funds on the Bitcoin blockchain.
